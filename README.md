# AFFIPred: AF2 Structure-based Functional Impact Predictor

A novel structure-based pathogenicity classifier, AFFIPred, merges both sequence and AF2-based structural information. This combination tackles limitations of traditional structure-based classifiers while maintaining accuracy. 
This repository contains jupyter-notebook files for training of three AFFIPred models and performance assessment results.
